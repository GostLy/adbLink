Version 5.7

http://www.jocala.com

adb binary updated to 34.0.4-10411341

aapt binary added for Windows & Mac. For Linux 
users, adbfiles has a symlink to 
/usr/bin/aapt which will need to be installed
via apt-get.

When using a Android 11/Fire OS 8.1 device, Kodi's 
MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is set
to "allow" (to permit Kodi to access local 
files outside of its sandbox). This occurs
when a backup is restored.  

See http://www.jocala.com/android11.html for
more details.

A "Set app permissions" function is added to the 
Utility menu to allow changing the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE 
status for any application that includes this permission in
its manifest. This is for Android 11/Fire OS 8.1 or greater 
devices only.

A "Get package name" function is added to the Utility 
menu. The package name is required to change the 
MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission for an application. This 
function requires the aapt utility mentioned above.

SpcCpy

For Android 11, Google has implemented scoped storage 
which  removes the ability for external applications to
write in /sdcard/Android/data/. This has the unfortunate
side-effect of preventing adbLink from accessing Kodi data at
 /sdcard/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi, meaning no backup/restore, no
 edit of xml files, or any function requiring write access.

adbLink now has the ability to relocate Kodi's files to
/sdcard/kodi_data/ where they are accessible for
 backup/restore, edit, etc. 

This workaround is mainly for Android 11,
but it works with other Android versions as well.

See further detail at http://www.jocala.com/android11.html
or in adbLink's built-in help.

adbLink 3.1 changelog  05/01/17

The file manager is now root-aware. Perform common file management
functions (copy,move,rename,mkdir,etc) on the /system and /data
partitions if your device is rooted.
 
When upgrading adbLink versions, data is preserved. Tested
with adbLink 2.04 and up. 

The database and log files are now stored in a standard
directory located in the user's $HOME. Mac users can
now run adbLink without admin privileges. 

The progress bar activity indicator is back.

Devices can be accessed on an ad hoc basis: double-clicking
a USB serial number or entering an IP address on-the-fly
allows interaction with the device w/o first creating
a device record. In this case, Kodi defaults are assumed. 

Notification messages: toast-style messages or normal style is
now a preference, with normal set as default.

A global folder location for files copied from your device
is set to your system $HOME. Changed to a global location of your
preference, or overridden by a per-device preference in a
device record.

Keypad now uses device address as dialog title

Log filename defaults to kodi.log or spmc.log depending on 
configuration

System help updated


adbLink 3.00 changelog

Parallel background processes: Potentially lengthy jobs (backup,restore,etc)
are now assigned a job ID and the running state is displayed in a
listbox. 

New file manager: Easy move/copy/delete of files and folders on
Android devices. Copy multiple files and folders from Android
devices to PC/Mac or from PC/Mac to Android device.

The progress bar style activity indicator has been replaced by a
color-changing icon. It turns green while background processes are
running, blue when the job queue is empty.

Please note that the progress bar widget was merely an indicator
of a background process running. It never measured time remaining,
but just ran until closed by a process ending.


The listbox of connected devices now shows device name not
IP address/USB serial number. For USB-connected devices, the
serial number is displayed only for devices that have not
been entered into the adbLink database.

File selection dialogs, log viewers and editors are now
resizeable.

Fixed: adbLink not working in space-embedded folder

adbLink 1.06 changelog
=======================

The Windows adbLink folder can now be installed
wherever you wish.  It has been tested under Windows 7
and XP. Shortcuts to adbLink.exe  work as expected. 

The adbLink folder is  where all files needed by adbLink.exe
kept. This folder holds adb.exe, scripts and various other files,
in addition to the adbLink.exe program. 

Samba networking has been added. Click  "Mount" and after your
usb storage mounts, it's exported via samba. Your /sdcard folder
is exported as well. The server name is adblink and the exports 
are /usb and /sdcard. Samba is persistent between boots if you 
check mounting to be persistent. 

In testing the adblink server and exported folders /sdcard and /usb
are visible to Windows XP and 7, OS X Mavericks and Linux Mint. Drag
and drop and other file management work as expected between the FireTV

adbLink 1.05 changelog
=======================

Both the Windows version and the OS X version can now be installed
wherever you wish.  

The Windows version of adbLink ships with a folder, named 
adbfiles. You can install the adbLink.exe program wherever
you wish, as long as the adbfiles folder is installed there also.

The adbfiles folder is  where all files needed by adbLink.exe
kept. This folder holds adb.exe, scripts and various other files. 

The OS X version of adbLink, adbLink.app is usually installed to
the /Application folder on your Mac. However you can move it
wherever you like. The Mac version of adbLink also has an adbfiles
folder, but it's inside the adbLink.app bundle.

adbLink now includes Llama, with permission from the developer at
KebabApps.com. Llama allows us to:

1. Boot AFTV directly to XBMC

2. Connect XBMC to the Classic TV app. This allows starting XBMC from
AFTV's upper level menus.

3. Both of the above.

The option to change the Classic TV icon to an XBMC or Kodi icon is
included. This can also be reversed, restoring the Default Classic TV icon.


The Preferences dialog has changed. If you open the 
preferences dialog then exit without changes,  the
"updates disabled/enabled" pop-up dialog is suppressed.  

adbLink can now check for updates when it starts, and open
the adbLink page to download the new version if desired.
This option is on by default, but can be turned off in
Preferences.

Preferences also has a "Check for updates" button. 

A dedicated button to change the XBMC splash screen has been added.
This was previously possible using the "adb push" button, selecting the
destination folder "media", but there have been requests for a 
dedicated button. Elmerhuso's XBMC splash screen and a Kodi splash
screen are included, and of course you can add your own. Drop them
into the "splash" folder.  

Clickable URL links are now included. Links include adbLink's home
page, jocala.com/adblink.html, the XBMC wiki, and links to the forum
topics where adbLink is supported, xda and xbmc. 

version number changed to constant.
