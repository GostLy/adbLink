To connect to a Windows Subsystem for Android virtual machine, click "WSA" checkbox.
 
 This will fill in: <br>
 Address: 127.0.0.1<br>
 Kodi partition: /sdcard/<br>
 File path: kodi_data/.kodi<br>
 Port: 58526
<p>

These are Microsoft's suggested settings to access 
WSA via adb. You can also access a WSA instance
via its host IP address, i.e. 192.168.1.10. Just make sure
the port address is 58526.

<p>
Windows Subsystem for Android is a  Android 11 variant for which
 Google has implemented scoped storage. This removes the
 ability for external applications to write in
  /sdcard/Android/data/. This has the unfortunate
side-effect of preventing adbLink from accessing Kodi data at
 /sdcard/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi, meaning no backup/restore, no
 edit of xml files, or any function requiring write access.
<p>
Luckily, Kodi has the ability to read its data files from a different
location as instructed by a text file: xbmc_env.properties. The new
location is /sdcard/kodi_data/org.xbmc.kodi.
<p>
 More detail regarding Android 11 is available <a href="android11.html">here</a>
<p>
The adbLink restore function will create the directory /sdcard/kodi_data
and restore a backup to that location and also write an xbmc_env.properties
file. After the restore, Kodi will operate normally.
<p>
adbLink's  backup function will backup Kodi's files from this new
location. Other functions, such as xml edit, will work as expected.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one
of the forums linked at jocala.com. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log,
with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
