The Utility menu function XAPK Install will allow installation of
XAPK files on your device.
<p>
An XAPK file is a package used to install Android apps on
mobile devices. It is similar to the standard .APK format, 
but may contain other assets used by the app, such as an
.OBB file, which stores graphics, media files, and other app
data. XAPK files are used for distributing apps on 
third-party Android app download websites. They are
not supported by Google Play.
