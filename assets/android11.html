     Google's Android 11, and Amazon's Fire OS 8.1 implement "Scoped Storage"
     which removes the ability of the adb program to access /sdcard/Android/data/. 
     <p>
     This has the unfortunate side-effect of preventing adblink from accessing
     Kodi's data located at /sdcard/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi. This means no 
     backup/restore, no cloning, no  edit of xml files, etc. 
<p>
     Luckily, Kodi allows us to relocate its data to an accessible location via
     the text file /sdcard/xbmc_env.properties. Kodi looks for this file at
     startup, and reads it to find the location for its data.
<p>

     When adblink connects to a device it will detect if scoped storage
     is in effect.
     <p>
     If scoped, and /sdcard/xbmc_env.properties does not exist, adblink will offer
     to create it and the /sdcard/kodi_data/ root folder for Kodi's data. This
     check at connection can be turned off in adblink's preferences.
     <p>
     You may also manually create /sdcard/kodi_data/ and xbmc_env.properties
     via the utility menu function, Create Kodi data.
     <p>
     When adblink creates the alternate location for Kodi's data,
     adblink will set the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to
     "allow" which will permit Kodi to read the xbmc_env.properties
     file at startup. Otherwise Kodi is not permitted to access local
     files outside of its sandbox.
     <p>
     
     If you need to grant or revoke the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission manually,
     you can do this for Kodi or any app  via adblink's Utility menu
     function: "Set app permissions".

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
