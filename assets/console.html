<b><u>Console</b></u><br>
The Console button opens a terminal where you can issue adb commands from the command-line or
perform other command-line tasks.<p>
This terminal session adds the adb command to your path, so it's available from any location on your PC.
<p>
This temporary path change is for the console session only.
