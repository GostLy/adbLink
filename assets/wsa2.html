wsaLink is a front end for Android's adb.exe utility tailored
specifically for Microsotft's Windows Subsystem for Android.
<p>
First, Windows Subsystem for Android must be active for this utility 
to function. Otherwise it has nothing to connect to!
<p>
To connect to WSA simply press the "connect button. This will open 
a connection to:
<p>
 
 Address: 127.0.0.1<br>
 Port: 58526
<p>

These are Microsoft's suggested settings to access 
WSA via the localhost interface.

<p>
If you wish to access a WSA instance via IP address rather than
localhost, enter the WSA IP address into the IP address text field then
press connect. This will open a connection using the supplied IP address
and port 5555.
<p> 

Be aware that this IP is not static. It will change every time you restart WSA. 
<p>

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com . wsaLink produces a log file, wsalink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
