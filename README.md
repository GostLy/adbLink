# adbLink
Official URL http://www.jocala.com

adbLink is used to connect/manage android devices.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide the source files to AUR (Arch User Repository) so it can be found/installed using the package manager on Arch Linux.

I am not the original author of adbLink and the source/binaries are available from the official website (link above.)
