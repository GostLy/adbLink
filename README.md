# adbLink
Official URL http://www.jocala.com

adbLink is used to connect/manage android devices.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide the source files to AUR (Arch User Repository) so it can be found/installed using 'pacman' on Arch Linux.

I have not edited any of the original source code.
